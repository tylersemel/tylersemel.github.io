                    <p>Dream Files is a 3D, first-person, puzzle-platformer game where you play as secret agent Magnus Mutus, a man sent on a mission inside a potential criminal's dreams. It was created with Unreal Engine 5.</p>
                    <p>I collaborated with two other software engineers to learn more about UE5 and create a cohesive experience with a strong narrative. This game features pickup mechanics for item interaction in puzzles, dialogue to introduce the player to the character's motivations, three distinct levels, a fog clearing mechanic, and Quixel bridge assets for a semi-realistic aesthetic. </p>

                    <h2>The Pixie's Prank</h2>
                    <p> The Pixie's Prank is a text adventure game created with Twine. It follows the story of pixie called Watt who was cursed to never laugh again by an evil wizard unless he pranks the king. This story has three main endings (bad, good, and best) as well as multiple fail states that lead to a game over. 
                    <p>This is a solo project in which I drew inspiration from fairy folklore from the 1800s to create a winding narrative for the main character, Watt. I utilized Twine's variables and conditional logic to allow the player to collect items to unlock certain events along the way. I ensured that the player can choose from blind choices, false choices, dilemmas, and flavor choices. I created this game with an open map branching narrative in mind, so that the player could have a sense of direction in the world. </p>

                    <h2>CoffeeMaker</h2>
                    <p>CoffeeMaker is a system for customers to order and pick up drinks from the staff that create and make these drinks. CoffeeMaker has functionality for creating a customer account, signing in as either a customer or staff, staff management of creation and deletion of drink recipes, updating the status of an ordered drink, placing a drink order for a customer, seeing a customer's previously ordered drinks, and updating inventory if an ingredient is out of stock.</p>
                    <p>I worked on this project for three months with four other software developers. This system was a pre-established one that we were tasked with adding all of the functionality listed above. We used Java, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Hibernate, Spring Boot, MySQL, and RESTful API to deliver the final product.</p>

                    <p>Recipe Social was created for a web development class in which myself and two other software engineers had to create a Progressive Web App for any topic we chose. We decided to make a PWA that would act as a social media for recipes, allowing users to create, store, and share recipes with friends. </p> 
                    <p>This project was created over the course of four months and we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, MariaDB, as well as Node.js to fully flesh out our system.</p>
